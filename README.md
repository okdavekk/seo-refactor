## Description: Horiseon Search Engine Optimization

Optimized web page for accessability and search engines, also simplified the page CSS and HTML where possible.  
- A majority of the work came from removing the div elements in favor of semantic HTML elements.
- The page CSS was reformatted to follow a logical structure with the HTML elements and the HTML elements now follow a logical structure.
- Alt accessability attributes are now added to the images.
- The heading attributes follow a sequential order now.
- The page has a concise and descriptive updated title.
